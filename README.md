# Simple YIFY
**A simple and lightweight GUI to the YIFY API**

A single HTML file with some CSS and JavaScript, that fetches a JSON file from the [YIFY API](https://yts.mx/api) and renders a responsive webpage with the last items released and search functionality, so you don't have to deal with the crapware of the original site.

It should even work locally (though it may trigger some [CORS error](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=cors+error)).

You can see it at work here â†’ [https://sieyin.github.io/yify/](https://sieyin.github.io/yify/)

Feel free to download it or copy it anywhere you see fit.
