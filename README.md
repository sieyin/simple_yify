# Simple YIFY
## A simple and lightweight GUI to the YIFY API

A single HTML file with some CSS and JavaScript, that fetches a JSON file from the [YIFY API](https://yts.mx/api) and renders a page with the last 48 items released and search functionality. It should even work locally (though it may trigger some [CORS error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71953553/disable-cors-in-brave-browser)).

Feel free to download it or copy it anywhere you see fit.
